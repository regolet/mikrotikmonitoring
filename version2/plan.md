# Migration Plan: Flask API + React Frontend (Hybrid Architecture)

## Overview
This document outlines the migration from a monolithic Flask/Jinja2 webapp to a hybrid architecture using Flask for the backend API and React for the frontend UI. The migration is now fully complete, with a modern, real-time, multi-router monitoring system, robust UI/UX, and production-ready features.

## ✅ COMPLETED STEPS

### 1. Project Structure ✅
```
version2/
  backend/      # Flask API (copied from v1 backend) ✅
  frontend/     # React app (created with create-react-app) ✅
  plan.md       # This migration plan ✅
  run_dev.bat   # Development workflow script ✅
```

### 2. Backend (Flask API) ✅
- ✅ All backend logic and data files migrated to `version2/backend/`
- ✅ Static HTML/JS removed from backend
- ✅ CORS enabled for API endpoints
- ✅ Endpoints: `/api/settings`, `/api/groups`, `/api/categories`, `/api/routers`, `/api/ppp_active`, `/api/dashboard`, etc.
- ✅ Real-time updates via WebSocket endpoint
- ✅ Router-aware API calls (multi-router support)
- ✅ Run with: `cd backend && python app.py`

### 3. Frontend (React) ✅
- ✅ React app in `version2/frontend/`
- ✅ Pages/tabs as React components:
  - ✅ Dashboard (real-time monitoring, stat cards, PPPoE table)
  - ✅ Groups (multi-select, card layout, real-time status)
  - ✅ Settings (router management, test connection)
  - ✅ Categories (category/subcategory management, group assignment)
- ✅ React Router for navigation
- ✅ Data fetching via axios, router-aware API calls
- ✅ Modern, responsive Bootstrap UI
- ✅ Real-time updates via single shared WebSocket connection (React Context)
- ✅ Global router menu (React Context)
- ✅ Run with: `cd frontend && npm start`

### 4. Dev Workflow ✅
- ✅ `run_dev.bat` starts both Flask and React dev servers
- ✅ React on port 3000, Flask on port 80

### 5. Testing & Validation ✅
- ✅ End-to-end tested (React <-> Flask)
- ✅ All API endpoints verified
- ✅ Responsive design validated
- ✅ Data flow and real-time updates validated
- ✅ All React warnings resolved
- ✅ WebSocket connection stable across router/tab switches

### 6. Production Deployment ✅
- ✅ React app builds for production (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Flask serves static React files in production
- ✅ Environment variables set for production
- ✅ Production deployment tested

### 7. Additional Features ✅
- ✅ Detailed error handling
- ✅ Loading states and animations
- ✅ Real-time updates using WebSocket
- ✅ UI/UX refinements (badges, card layouts, padding, borders, etc.)
- ✅ Groups Summary tab (category/subcategory management)
- ✅ Single shared WebSocket connection (React Context)
- ✅ Global router state (React Context)
- ✅ Removal of legacy/duplicate code
